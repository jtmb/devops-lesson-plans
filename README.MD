### <h1>About</h1>

This repository is a **beginner-friendly DevOps learning project** designed to provide a clear, structured path for building core DevOps skills.  
Through hands-on practice, you will learn how to set up and work with:

- A local development environment using **WSL (Ubuntu)**
- Source control with **Git & GitHub**
- A remote server on **AWS EC2**
- Containerization with **Docker**
- Configuration management with **Ansible**
- More comming soon  **(Under Construction ðŸš§)**

In addition, youâ€™ll find reference materials that explain **what DevOps is**, supported by diagrams, curated resources, and best practices.

âš¡ **Learning recommendation:** While this project is self-paced, it is **best used alongside guidance from a mentor** who can answer questions, explain tricky concepts, and help you apply the material to real-world scenarios. These packets are designed as **supplementary learning resources** to support that mentorship journey.
